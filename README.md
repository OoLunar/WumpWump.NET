## Long Term Forking

If you plan on forking the library and making significant changes, I request for only two things:

1. Please do not discredit any of the contributors to the library unless if you remove their contributions. We have worked hard to make this library what it is today, and we would appreciate it if you could respect that.
2. Please link to the original repository in your fork's README.md. This is not a requirement, but it would be greatly appreciated.
